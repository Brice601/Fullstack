        "### Definition\n",
        "Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### A bit of History\n",
        "\n",
        "It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic illustration of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, with applications and innovations in many fields of medicine and science which are often intertwined with each other. They also connect with the rise of statistical thinking and widespread data collection for planning and commerce up through the 19th century.\n",

        "\n",
        "The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude by at least 200 B.C !\n",
        "\n",
        "Along the way, a variety of advancements contributed to the widespread use of data visualization today. These include technologies for drawing and reproducing images, advances in mathematics and statistics, and new developments in data collection, empirical observation and recording."

        "\n",
        "The differences between graphics for presentation and graphics for exploration lie in both form and practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Presentation\n",
        "Presentation graphics are generally static, and a single graphic is drawn to summarize the information to be presented. These displays should be of high quality and include complete definitions and explanations of the variables shown and of the form of the graphic. One must understand in a glance what is represented in the figure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presentation graphics are like proofs of mathematical theorems; they may give no hint as to how a result was reached, but they should offer **convincing** support for its conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploratory graphics\n",
        "Exploratory graphics, on the other hand, are used for looking for results. Very many of them may be used, and they should be fast and informative rather than slow and precise. They are not intended for presentation, so that detailed legends and captions are unnecessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "One presentation graphic will be drawn for viewing by potentially thousands of readers while thousands of exploratory graphics may be drawn to support the data investigations of one analyst."

        "\n",
        "Graphic displays are often very effective at communicating information. They are also very often not effective at communicating information. Two important reasons for this state of affairs are that graphics can be produced with a few clicks of the mouse without any thought and the design of graphics is not taken seriously by many data scientists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some people seem to think that preparing good graphics is just a matter of common sense, while others believe that preparing graphics is a low-level task not worthy of attention. These two asumptions are completely false!\n",

        "Knowing how to make effective visualizations is fundamental when dealing with data, whatever the purpose of the project: EDA, dashboarding, pure statistics, machine learning... You will never work \"blindly\" !\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a good graphic?\n",
        "What is plotted comes first, and without content no amount of clever design can bring meaning to a display. A good graphic will convey information, but a graphic is always part of a larger whole, the context, which provides its relevance. So a good graphic will complement other related material and fit in, both in terms of content and also with respect to style and layout. Finally, if a graphic is constructed and drawn well, it will look good.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a given dataset there is not a great deal of advice which can be given on content and context. Those who know their own data should know best for their specific purposes. **It is advisable to think hard about what should be shown and to check with others if the graphic makes the desired impression.**\n",
        "\n",
        "However, some basic guidelines should be followed:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Consistency:** sets of graphics should be in similar style and use equivalent scaling\n",
        "* **Proximity:** place graphics on the same page, or on the facing page, of any text that refers to them\n",
        "* **Layout:** graphics should be neither too small nor too large and be attractively positioned relative to the whole page or display\n",

        "### About colorscales\n",
        "Color is very important in data visualization. It is very helpful to catch your audience's attention towards what you want to highlight. However, it can also be very misleading if you don't choose the right colorscale!\n",
